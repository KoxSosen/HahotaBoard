# HahotaScoreboard

Lightweight Scoreboard plugin for Paper servers.

This plugin only works on 1.16.5 paper servers.
Softdepeds:
- Vault
- Essentials(X)

This plugin reads both the balance, and both the prefix from Vault, therefore it works with almost all economy/permission plugins using Vault.

Huge credit goes to BigLev for helping with the code.
