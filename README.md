Lightweight scoreboard plugin for Paper servers.

This plugin only works on 1.16.5 paper servers.

Softdepends:
- Vault
- Essentials(X)

This plugin reads both the balance, and both the prefix from Vault, therefore it works with almost all economy/permission plugins using Vault.

# Coming sooon

- Config to set lines and update rate manually.
- ```hscore cpu``` command for usage
- Papi support (optional)
- Placholders instead of getters.
